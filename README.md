# Data-Science

# Welcome to the Data Science Repository!

This repository is designed as a comprehensive resource for learning and implementing data science concepts. Whether you're just starting or an experienced data scientist, you'll find valuable materials, hands-on projects, and code examples covering the entire data science pipeline. Explore, experiment, and enhance your skills with real-world applications!

# 1_PYTHON
This folder contains comprehensive materials and exercises for mastering Python programming in the context of data science. It includes:

- Basic programming concepts (variables, loops, functions, object-oriented programming).
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets) with practical applications.
- Data manipulation using Pandas (DataFrames, merging, grouping, filtering).
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts).
- File handling (CSV, Excel, JSON files).
- Basic automation scripts for handling real-world datasets.
This section helps in building a strong Python foundation necessary for data analysis and machine learning.

# 2_SQL
Master SQL for data science with PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source database system. This folder covers:

- Fundamental queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Filtering and sorting (WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING).
- Joins and subqueries (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, nested queries).
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, PARTITION BY).
- Indexing and performance tuning for optimizing queries.
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and Recursive Queries.
- JSON and Array handling in PostgreSQL.
Includes hands-on exercises using PostgreSQL to ensure proficiency in managing and analyzing large datasets.

# 3_STATISTICS
This section provides statistical concepts necessary for data-driven decision-making:

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).
- Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson).
- Inferential statistics (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, p-values).
- Correlation and causation (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlations).
- Regression analysis (linear, logistic regression).
- ANOVA and chi-square tests for categorical data analysis.
- Practical examples and exercises ensure a strong statistical foundation for data science.

# 4_CRISP_ML
This folder covers the CRISP-DM framework for machine learning projects, including:

- Understanding business objectives (problem definition and success criteria).
- Data understanding (data exploration and visualization).
- Data preparation (cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values).
- Model building (choosing and training models).
- Model evaluation (metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE).
- Deployment and monitoring (model serving and performance tracking).
- Includes best practices, case studies, and project templates for end-to-end ML workflows.

# 5_Agglomerative_Clustering

- Agglomerative is a bottom-up approach, in which the algorithm starts with taking all data points as single clusters and merging them until one cluster is left.
  
This folder focuses on Agglomerative Clustering, a hierarchical clustering method used in unsupervised learning. It covers:

- Understanding Hierarchical Clustering: How agglomerative clustering works by merging similar data points iteratively.
- Dendrograms: Visualization of hierarchical relationships and choosing the optimal number of clusters.
- Linkage Methods:
- -  Single Linkage (minimum distance between clusters).
 -  Complete Linkage (maximum distance between clusters).
 -  Average Linkage (mean distance between clusters).
 -  Wardâ€™s Method (minimizing variance).
- Distance Metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine distance calculations.
- Comparing Agglomerative Clustering with K-Means: When to use hierarchical methods.
- Implementation in Python:
 - Using scipy.cluster.hierarchy to create dendrograms.
 - Using sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering for clustering tasks.
- Real-World Applications:
 - Customer segmentation.
 - Document classification.
 - Image segmentation.
Includes hands-on exercises and practical case studies to reinforce learning.
